## wait for aws state changes
Wait for things in AWS to complete before continuing pipeline.

Run any low-level boto3 client `wait()` from `get_waiter`.

Waiters use a client's service operations to poll the status of an AWS
resource and suspend execution until the AWS resource reaches the state
that the waiter is polling for or a failure occurs while polling.

<http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/clients.html#waiters>

## input
The input context requires:

```yaml
awsWaitIn:
  serviceName: 'service name' # Available services here: http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/
  waiterName: 'waiter name' # Check service docs for available waiters for each service
  waiterArgs:
    arg1Name: arg1Value # optional. Dict. kwargs for get_waiter
  waitArgs:
    arg1Name: arg1Value #optional. Dict. kwargs for wait
```

The `awsWaitIn` input supports [text {substitution} formatting expressions]({{< ref "/docs/substitutions">}}).
