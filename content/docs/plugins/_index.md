# plugins
pypyr core stays deliberately light so the dependencies are down to the 
minimum. I loathe installs where there're a raft of extra deps
that I don't use clogging up the system.

When and if you need other libraries, you can selectively choose to add this 
functionality by installing a pypyr plugin.
