# magritte
Very serious ontological statement about pipes.

Run me like this:
```text
$ pypyr magritte
```

Deep Lore: I tend to use this as a quick smoke test to verify pypyr installed as
expected. If this seemingly silly pipeline works, you know pypyr can run, find
pipelines and that built-ins installed as expected.
