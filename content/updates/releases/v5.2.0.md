# pypyr release v5.2.0
## encoding & config
Release Date: 2022-02-19T18:41:22Z

- pypyr is now configurable with yaml or `pyproject.toml`! See [pypyr
  config]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/config" >}}) for details.
  - You can now use variables from a config file like `pyproject.toml` in
    your pipeline with [pypyr.steps.configvars]({{< ref "/docs/steps/configvars">}}).
- You can now explicitly over-ride the default system encoding on any
  [filesystem operations]({{< ref "/topics/filesystem" >}}).
  - On the steps with in and out files, you can seamlessly convert between
    different encodings - so you can have an input file in one encoding, and
    the output file in another.
- New [pypyr.steps.python]({{< ref "/docs/steps/python" >}}) step to get the
  full path to the Python executable in the current environment.
  - This is handy when you're inside a virtual environment and you want to run
    Python as a sub-process.
- Although pypyr has always been compatible with Windows for end-users, the
  automated unit test suite now runs on Windows natively also, whereas before
  pypyr core contributors on Windows needed to use WSL to do build verification.
