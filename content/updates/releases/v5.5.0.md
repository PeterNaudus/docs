# pypyr release v5.5.0
## concurrent cmds & cmdOut dot notation
Release Date: 2022-05-26T13:18:48Z

- Introduce [pypyr.steps.cmds]({{< ref "/docs/steps/cmds" >}}) &
  [pypyr.steps.shells]({{< ref "/docs/steps/shells" >}}) to run programs or
  shell statements asynchronously as parallel (concurrent) sub-processes.
  - This means all the parallel commands start at the same time and run
    concurrently, rather than run serially one after the other.

```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.cmds
  comment: copy 3 files concurrently
  in:
    cmds:
      - cp file1.ext /media/vol1/
      - cp file2.ext /media/vol2/file2-archive.ext
      - cp file3.ext /media/vol3/
```

- `cmdOut` for [pypyr.steps.cmd]({{< ref "/docs/steps/cmd" >}}) &
  [pypyr.steps.shell]({{< ref "/docs/steps/shell" >}}) gets dotted attribute
  access.
  - instead of `cmdOut[returncode]` access value like this: `cmdOut.returncode`
  - backwards compatible - the old-style dict-like accessors will still work.
  - This applies to the old serial cmd/shell steps, and also to the new parallel
    cmds/shells steps introduced in this release.
  - Where previously you had to use the cumbersome dict-style \[accessors\] you
    can now use dotted attribute access instead::
```yaml
# old style
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  run: !py "cmdOut['returncode'] == 0"
  in:
    echoMe: "you'll only see me if cmd ran successfully with return code 0.
            the command output was: {cmdOut[stdout]}.
            the error output was: {cmdOut[stderr]}."

# new style
- name: pypyr.steps.echo
  run: !py cmdOut.returncode == 0
  in:
    echoMe: "you'll only see me if cmd ran successfully with return code 0.
            the command output was: {cmdOut.stdout}.
            the error output was: {cmdOut.stderr}."
```

- Set default encoding for all the cmd/shell steps using
  [default_cmd_encoding]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/config#default_cmd_encoding" >}})
  in config.
  - You can use the $env variable [PYPYR_CMD_ENCODING]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/config#pypyr_cmd_encoding" >}})
    to initialize this value, in addition to the usual config files.
