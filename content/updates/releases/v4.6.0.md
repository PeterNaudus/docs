# pypyr release v4.6.0
## set, add, append.
Release Date: 2021-10-06T11:20:21Z

* `contextsetf` now has a simpler, shorter alias [set]({{< ref "/docs/steps/set">}}).
    * The old, longer form `contextsetf` will keep on working, so you don't HAVE to change your pipelines.
    * But hopefully the new shorter `set` syntax saves you some typing in the future!
* Create lists & append items to it with [pypyr.steps.append]({{< ref "/docs/steps/append">}})
* Create sets & add items to it with [pypyr.steps.add]({{< ref "/docs/steps/add">}})
* Since Python 3.6 security updates end 12/21, pypyr now only officially checks
  compatibility only for Python >=3.7.
  * Python 3.6 *should* keep on working as before, because there isn't (currently)
    particularly anything that would fail on Python 3.6.
  * But please be aware that as of now new releases won't guarantee Python 3.6
    compatibility.
