## context parser initialize to empty rather than None
Release Date: 2021-01-01T14:54:19Z

- Context parsers that create an entry in context now initialize to empty rather
  than `None`.
  - This means you can directly use something like `{argList}`, `{argDict}` and
    `argString` (initializing respectively to `[]`, `{}`, `''`) directly for
    things like `foreach` loops without having to worry about `None` checks.
    Your existing truthy checks for these values will work as before. closes
    #214.

## how to upgrade
