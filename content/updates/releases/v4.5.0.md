## retry backoff & cleaner api init
Release Date: 2021-02-02T11:18:53Z

- Add [retry backoff strategies]({{<ref
  "/docs/decorators/retry#backoff-algorithms">}}).
    - You can now use retry backoff algorithms like exponential or linear to
      control the sleep interval in between retries.
    - The default [fixed retry sleep interval]({{< ref
      "/docs/decorators/retry#fixed-list-of-sleep-intervals" >}}) now supports a
      list input, so the next sleep interval between retries can come from a
      list you provide yourself.
    - Ref #216.
- For API consumers:
    - Prevent duplicates in `sys.path` (#218) on main* api entry points.
      thread-safe existence check on `sys.path` list.
    - Prevent redundant multiple addition of `notify` log-level on main* api
      entry. Move initialization code to package `__init__` (#219).
    - All of this is backward compatible, this notice is informational only, no
      change required on your code.
