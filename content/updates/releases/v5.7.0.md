# pypyr release v5.7.0
## switch & argskwargs
Release Date: 2022-10-20T15:00:13Z

## summary
- New [switch]({{< ref "/docs/steps/switch">}}) step for IF-ELSE style branching
  in your pipelines!
- New [argskwargs]({{< ref "/docs/context-parsers/argskwargs" >}}) parser to
  combine plain args and key-value pairs (key=value) from the cli.
- [keyvaluepairs]({{< ref "/docs/context-parsers/keyvaluepairs" >}}) and
  [dict]({{< ref "/docs/context-parsers/dict" >}}) parsers now support having
  `=` in the value, so you can have `key=one+one=two` parse to `{'key': 'one+one=two'}`
  - these parsers now also support passing args with no `=`, in which case
    `arg1` becomes `{'arg1': ''}`
