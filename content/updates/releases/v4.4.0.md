# pypyr release v4.4.0
## simplified py step syntax & imports for !py strings.
Release Date: 2020-12-26T15:50:27Z

- New step [pypyr.steps.pyimport]({{< ref "/docs/steps/pyimport" >}}) to import
  references to the `!py` string namespace.
    - This includes an underlying api signature change by removal of
      `pypyr.utils.expressions.eval_string()`, but this is sufficiently far down
      the call-chain that it shouldnâ€™t affect any normal pipeline operator or
      api consumer.
- [pypyr.steps.contextclearall]({{< ref "/docs/steps/contextclearall" >}}) wipes
  `pyimport` imported references in addition to the key/values inside context.
- Simplify `pypyr.steps.py` syntax by allowing a new `py` (rather than `pycode`)
  input. This allows pipeline authors to use context key names directly as
  variables, rather than have to specify them as keys in context (`my_var` vs
  `context[â€˜my_varâ€™]`).
    - See [pypyr.steps.py]({{< ref "/docs/steps/py" >}}) for details on how to
      use the new style input.
    - the old `pycode` style will keep on working in the same way, so no need to
      worry about backwards compatibility for your existing pipelines.
- Allow substitutions on [retry]({{< ref "/docs/decorators/retry" >}}) `max`.
  Resolves #207. Excellent bug find & fix by @Reskov, much thanks ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ ðŸ™Œ  as
  ever for a superb contribution! ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥
- `foreach` can now use any iterable, including generators. See how you can use
  this for [flattening nested for loops]({{< ref
  "/docs/decorators/foreach#flatten-nested-loops" >}}) to simplify your
  pipelines when you have multiple nested `foreach` loops.
