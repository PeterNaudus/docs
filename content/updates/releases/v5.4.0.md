# pypyr release v5.4.0
## run multiple commands & shell statements in same step
Release Date: 2022-04-14T17:44:08Z

## summary
- [pypyr.steps.cmd]({{< ref "/docs/steps/cmd" >}}) &
  [pypyr.steps.shell]({{< ref "/docs/steps/shell" >}}) now also takes a list
  input to run multiple commands/shell statements in the same step!
```yaml
- name: pypyr.steps.cmd
  in:
    cmd: echo 0

- name: pypyr.steps.cmd
  in:
    cmd:
      - echo 1
      - echo 2

- name: pypyr.steps.cmd
  in:
    cmd:
      run:
        - echo 3
        - echo 4
      save: False
      cwd: mydir/subdir
```
- Both the `cmd` and `shell` steps expanded to allow:
  - decode output in different encodings
  - save output as raw bytes or as encoded text.
  - File output for stdout/stderr.
    - File create mode of append or overwrite.
  - `stderr` can redirect to `/dev/stdout`
  - Both `stdout` & `stderr` can redirect to `/dev/null`

```yaml
#  when save: True
- name: pypyr.steps.cmd
  comment: when save is True
  in:
    cmd:
      run: curl https://myurl.blah/diblah
      save: True
      cwd: .
      bytes: False
      encoding: utf-8

#  when save: False (this is default)
- name: pypyr.steps.cmd
  comment: when save is False (the default when `save` not set)
  in:
    cmd:
      run: curl --cert certfile --key keyfile https://myurl.blah/diblah
      cwd: ..
      stdout: ./path/out.txt
      stderr: ./path/err.txt
      append: False
```
