# pypyr release v5.6.0
## venv create & new flit build internals
Release Date: 2022-10-05T17:43:44Z

## summary
- Use a custom error message when [pypyr.steps.assert]({{< ref "/docs/steps/assert#set-custom-error-message" >}})
  raises an exception.
- new [pypyr.steps.venv]({{< ref "/docs/steps/venv" >}}) step to create venvs
  in parallel from yaml or toml config.
- new [venv-create]({{< ref "/docs/pipelines/built-in/venv-create">}}) built-in
  pipeline so you can provision venvs concurrently from declarative config
  without having to write your own pipeline or script.
- pypyr is now built & packaged by the excellent PEP517 compliant [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/).
- Log level warning and higher goes to stderr, lower levels to stdout.
- Some minor optimizations, no functional change.
