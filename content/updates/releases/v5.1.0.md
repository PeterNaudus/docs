# pypyr release v5.1.0
## toml & text+binary file read/write
Release Date: 2021-12-12T19:57:55Z

Finally, toml, has come, to pypyr! ðŸŽ† 
  - [pypyr.parser.tomlfile]({{< ref "/docs/context-parsers/tomlfile" >}}) to initialize pipeline context with a toml file
  - [pypyr.steps.fetchtoml]({{< ref "/docs/steps/fetchtoml" >}}) to read toml file into context as an object with typing
  - [pypyr.steps.filewritetoml]({{< ref "/docs/steps/filewritetoml" >}}) to write specified context to output toml file - lets you create toml files on-the-fly programmatically.
  - [pypyr.steps.fileformattoml]({{< ref "/docs/steps/fileformattoml" >}}) to read input toml file(s) specified by path, glob or list of paths, replace {formatting expressions} and write to output file(s).
  
Working with files:
- [pypyr.steps.fileread]({{< ref "/docs/steps/fileread" >}}) to read files in text or binary mode into context.
- [pypyr.steps.filewrite]({{< ref "/docs/steps/filewrite" >}}) to write or append to file in text or binary modes.
